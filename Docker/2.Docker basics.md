# Docker for Developers - Part 2: Docker Basics

## Docker Images and Docker Containers

`Docker Images` are read-only templates that contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and environment settings needed to run an application. They serve as the blueprint for creating Docker Containers.

`Docker Containers` are the running instances of Docker Images. They encapsulate the application and its environment, allowing it to run consistently across different systems. Containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, making them efficient in terms of resource usage.

### Docker Engine 
The `Docker Engine` is the core component of Docker that enables the building, shipping, and running of Docker containers. It consists of a server (a long-running daemon process), a REST API for interacting with the daemon, and a command-line interface (CLI) client. The Docker Engine is responsible for managing Docker images, containers, networks, and storage.

### Docker CLI
The `Docker Command-Line Interface (CLI)` is a tool that allows users to interact with the Docker Engine through command-line commands. It provides a way to manage Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes. Common Docker CLI commands include:
- `docker run -it <image_name>`: Run a Docker container interactively from a specified image.
- `docker build`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker run`: Create and start a Docker container from an image.
- `docker ps`: List running Docker containers.
- `docker images`: List available Docker images on the local system.
- `docker stop`: Stop a running Docker container.
- `docker rm`: Remove a Docker container.
- `docker rmi`: Remove a Docker image.
