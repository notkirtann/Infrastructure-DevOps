# Docker for Developers - Part 2: Docker Basics

## Docker Images and Docker Containers

`Docker Images` are read-only templates that contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and environment settings needed to run an application. They serve as the blueprint for creating Docker Containers.

`Docker Containers` are the running instances of Docker Images. They encapsulate the application and its environment, allowing it to run consistently across different systems. Containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, making them efficient in terms of resource usage.
