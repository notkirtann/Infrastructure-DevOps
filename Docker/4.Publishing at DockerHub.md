# Docker for Developers - Part 4: Publishing at DockerHub

## What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker that allows developers to store, share, and manage Docker images. It serves as a central repository where you can publish your Docker images, making them accessible to others. Docker Hub also provides features such as automated builds, webhooks, and integration with popular CI/CD tools.
## Creating a Docker Hub Account
1. To publish Docker images to Docker Hub, you first need to create an account.
2. Once you have an account, you can create repositories to host your Docker images.
3. Create a new repository by clicking on the "Create Repository" button on your Docker Hub dashboard. Provide a name, description, and visibility settings (public or private) for your repository.
4. After creating the repository, you will be provided with the commands needed to push your Docker images to Docker Hub.
5. Make sure to log in to Docker Hub from your terminal using the following command:
```bash
docker login
```
## Tagging Your Docker Image
Before pushing your Docker image to Docker Hub, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and the repository name. The tagging format is as follows:
```bash
docker tag <local_image_name>:<tag> <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```
For example, if your Docker Hub username is `kirtan`, your repository is `my-app`, and your local image is `my-app-image:latest`, you would tag it like this:
```bash
docker tag my-app-image:latest kirtan/my-app:latest
```
## Pushing Your Docker Image to Docker Hub
Once your image is tagged, you can push it to Docker Hub using the following command:
```bash
docker push <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```
For example:
```bash
docker push kirtan/my-app:latest
```
Docker will upload your image to the specified repository on Docker Hub. You can monitor the progress in your terminal.
## Verifying Your Image on Docker Hub
After pushing your image, you can verify that it has been successfully uploaded by visiting your Docker Hub repository page. You should see the new image listed there along with its tags and other details.
## Pulling Your Docker Image from Docker Hub
To use your Docker image on another machine or share it with others, you can pull it from Docker Hub using the following command:
```bash
docker pull <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```
For example:
```bash
docker pull kirtan/my-app:latest
```
This command will download the image to your local machine, allowing you to run containers based on that image.
