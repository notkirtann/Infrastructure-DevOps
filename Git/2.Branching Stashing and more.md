# Branching, Merging and conflicts

- Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to create separate lines of development within a repository. Each branch represents an independent version of the codebase, allowing you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- To create a new branch, you can use the command `git branch <branch_name>`. This creates a new branch based on the current branch.
- To switch to a different branch, you can use the command `git checkout <branch_name>`. This updates your working directory to reflect the state of the selected branch.
- Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. To merge a branch into the current branch, you can use the command `git merge <branch_name>`. This combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
- Branching and merging enable collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously and integrate their changes seamlessly.
- Conflicts can occur during the merging process when changes made in different branches affect the same lines of code. When a conflict arises, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the affected files, and you will need to manually resolve the conflicts by editing the files.
- After resolving conflicts, you need to stage the changes using `git add <file>` and then commit the merge using `git commit`. This finalizes the merge and incorporates the resolved changes into the current branch.

## Useful Git Commands

- `git diff`: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area or between two commits.
- `git reset <file>`: Unstages a file from the staging area.
- `git rm <file>`: Removes a file from the working directory and stages the removal for commit.
- `git stash`: Temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not yet ready to be committed.
- `git stash pop`: Applies the most recent stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
- `git remote`: Manages remote repository connections.
- `git fetch`: Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into the local repository.
- `git tag <tag_name>`: Creates a tag for a specific commit, often used for marking release points.
- `git show <commit_hash>`: Displays detailed information about a specific commit.
- `git cherry-pick <commit_hash>`: Applies the changes from a specific commit onto the current branch.

### Git Diff and Stashing

- `git diff` is a command that shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area or between two commits. It highlights the changes made to files, allowing you to see what has been added, modified, or deleted.
- You can use `git diff` without any arguments to see the differences between the working directory and the staging area. This helps you review changes before staging them.
- You can also specify two commits to compare their differences using `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`.

- `git stash` is a command that temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not yet ready to be committed. It allows you to set aside your changes and revert to a clean working directory.
- When you run `git stash`, Git saves your changes and restores the working directory to the state of the last commit. This is useful when you need to switch branches or work on something else without committing your current changes.
- To apply the most recent stashed changes and remove them from the stash, you can use `git stash pop`. This restores your changes to the working directory.
- You can also use `git stash list` to see a list of all stashed changes and `git stash apply <stash_id>` to apply a specific stash without removing it from the stash list.
- Stashing is a convenient way to manage temporary changes and allows you to switch contexts without losing your work. It is especially useful when you need to quickly switch branches or work on a different task without committing incomplete changes.

### More Git Commands

- `git log --oneline`: Displays a condensed version of the commit history, showing only the commit hash and message.
- `git log --graph`: Shows a graphical representation of the commit history, illustrating the branching and merging structure.
- `git log --author="Author Name"`: Filters the commit history to show only commits made by a specific author.
- `git log checkout <branch_name>`: Shows the commit history for a specific branch.
- `git switch <branch_name>`: A newer command that serves the same purpose as `git checkout` for switching branches, but with a clearer syntax.
- `git switch -c <branch_name>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it in one command.
- `git restore <file>`: Discards changes in the working directory and restores the file to the last committed state.
- `git reflog`: Shows a log of all reference updates, including commits, branch changes, and other actions that affect the repository's history.
