## Git Rebase

- Git rebase is a powerful command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or combining a sequence of commits. It is often used to maintain a clean and linear project history.
- The basic syntax for rebasing is `git rebase <branch_name>`, where `<branch_name>` is the branch you want to rebase onto the current branch.
- When you run `git rebase <branch_name>`, Git will take the commits from the current branch and replay them on top of the specified branch. This effectively moves the base of the current branch to the tip of the specified branch.
- Rebasing can be particularly useful when you want to incorporate the latest changes from a main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) into your feature branch before merging it back. This helps to avoid unnecessary merge commits and keeps the commit history clean.
- However, it is important to note that rebasing rewrites the commit history, which can lead to complications if the branch has already been shared with others. It is generally recommended to avoid rebasing public branches that others may be working on.

#### Note

- Always make sure to communicate with your team before performing a rebase, especially if the branch has been shared. If you need to rebase a shared branch, consider using `git pull --rebase` to fetch and rebase in one step, which can help minimize conflicts and maintain a cleaner history.

- Always run rebase from the branch you want to rebase, not the branch you want to rebase onto. For example, if you want to rebase `feature` onto `main`, you should first checkout `feature` and then run `git rebase main`.

### Interactive Rebase

- Git also provides an interactive mode for rebasing, which allows you to edit, reorder, squash, or drop commits during the rebase process. You can start an interactive rebase with the command `git rebase -i <commit_hash>`, where `<commit_hash>` is the commit you want to rebase onto (or the number of commits you want to go back).
- In the interactive rebase interface, you can choose to:
  - `pick`: Use the commit as is.
  - `reword`: Use the commit but edit the commit message.
  - `edit`: Use the commit but stop to allow changes before continuing.
  - `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one.
  - `fixup`: Combine this commit with the previous one and discard the commit message.
  - `drop`: Remove the commit from the history.
- Interactive rebasing is a powerful way to clean up your commit history before merging, allowing you to create a more meaningful and organized commit log.
