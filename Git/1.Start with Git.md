# Git GitHub - Theory and Pratical

A version control system is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to their code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. Git is one of the most popular version control systems used in software development.

## Diffrence between Git and GitHub

- Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It is a tool that you install on your local machine.
- GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user interface and additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clones an existing Git repository from a remote source
- `git add <file>`: Stages changes to be committed.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- `git status`: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: Shows the commit history for the current branch. `q` to exit the log view.
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switches to the specified branch.
- `git merge <branch_name>`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

### Basic Workflow

1. Initialize a Git repository using `git init` or clone an existing one using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. Make changes to your files.  
3. Stage the changes using `git add <file>` or `git add .` to stage all changes.
4. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "commit message"
5. Push the changes to a remote repository using `git push`.
6. To update your local repository with changes from the remote repository, use `git pull`.

## .git hidden folder

- When you initialize a Git repository, a hidden folder named `.git` is created in the root directory of your project. This folder contains all the information about the repository, including configuration settings, commit history, branches, and more.

- The `.git` folder is essential for Git to function properly, and it should not be modified or deleted manually. Instead, use Git commands to interact with the repository.

- Inside the `.git` folder, you will find several important subdirectories and files, such as:
  - `HEAD`: A file that points to the current branch reference.
  - `config`: A file that contains repository-specific configuration settings.
  - `objects/`: A directory that stores all the objects (commits, trees, blobs) in the repository.
  - `refs/`: A directory that contains references to branches and tags.
    - `logs/`: A directory that contains logs of changes made to the references.
    - `heads/`: A directory that contains references to the heads of branches.
    - `tags/`: A directory that contains references to tags.

- Understanding the structure and contents of the `.git` folder can help you better understand how Git works under the hood. However, it is generally recommended to interact with Git through its commands rather than directly manipulating the files in the `.git` folder.

## Workflow with GitHub

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
3. Make changes to your files locally.
4. Stage and commit your changes using `git add <file>` and `git commit -m "commit message"`.
5. Push your changes to the GitHub repository using `git push`.
6. To collaborate with others, you can create branches, make changes, and open pull requests on GitHub.
7. Review and merge pull requests to integrate changes into the main branch.
8. Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local repository up to date using `git pull`.

### Staging Area

- The staging area, also known as the index, is an intermediate area where changes are gathered before they are committed to the repository. When you make changes to your files, they are not immediately committed; instead, you need to stage them first using the `git add` command.
- The staging area allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. You can stage specific files or even specific parts of a file.
- Once you have staged the desired changes, you can commit them to the repository using the `git commit` command. The commit will include all the changes that were staged in the staging area.
- The staging area provides flexibility and control over the commit process, allowing you to create meaningful and organized commits.
